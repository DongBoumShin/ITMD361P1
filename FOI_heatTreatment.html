  <h1>What I gathered on the web about Heat Treatment of steel</h1>
  <h2>Focused on high-carbon tool/blade steel, mainly on one type of stainless steel : CPM 154CM.</h2>
  
  <h3>Heat treatment</h3>
    <h4>Basic introduction</h4>
      <p>Not many, at least not many normal people know what heat treating is, let alone what the entire field of metallurgy studies. As the author of this article, I must sincerely apologize for I also am a novice, and I am writing this article as a note, or a memo of my findings across the Internet for my needs. Therefore, I cannot ensure that the terminology, glossary nor scientific knowledge provided is reliable for academic use.</p>
      <p>With that said, I did have interest, and I had researched the topic on a hobbyist level. Also,since being on the Internet means whoever with the mic is correct, I may carry on to explain on the very basic level, what heat treating is. </p>
    <h4>Heat Treating Processes</h4>
      <p>Heat treating is a field of study in the domain of metallurgy, which in turn is a subset of material science. Without delving into too complex a region, heat treating is a set of actions taken to change characteristics of a given piece of any metal in general. As different metals obviously have different properties and molecular structures, the procedure differs greatly for each material.</p>
      <p>The four main procedures taken are named 'Annealing', 'Normalizing', 'Quenching', and 'Tempering.' 
      Other methods exist, such as 'Cryogenic treatment' but they are not often used and I cannot utilize them, so I have not enough information to provide.</p>
      <p>I have no uses for annealing and normalizing also, but they are worth mentioning for they are used in every forge on Earth. Annealing is used to soften and relieve stress built into the metal while being forged. Normalizing is used to equalize, a.k.a. normalize the characteristics across a given piece of metal. Both procedures undergo similar steps, which include bringing the temperature up to a certain degree and letting it cool slowly. Specific temperatures and cooling time, speed differ from on procedure and metal to another.</p>
      <p>Quenching and tempering are often treated together, and for good reason too. In the case of high-carbon tool steels, quenching is used to give hardness, but the stress given to the metal makes it brittle enough to shatter. Tempering is used to relieve stress and get rid of some of it's brittleness, enabling the metal to be put to actual use. Tempering differs from annealing and normalizing for it is used to preserve hardness in a piece of metal, rather than to remove it.</p>
